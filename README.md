# hello-world

Getting started with git-hub to be able to save progress and publish my code. I work on the carbon cycle and how nutrients move through the soil when plants are present. Many of my experiments use stable and radioactive isotopes, experimental and observational approches. I  like to combine applied real world experiments with models to understand the soil C feedback to the atmosphere in a changing climate. I work primarlily in R and MATLAB.
